# 🎨 Frontend Interview Exercise

## 📑 What to code

The exercise is to build a simple front-end web application that has two screens:
a user sign-up form, and a user admin screen.

Some sample screenshots have been provided but you are welcome to use your own design instead.  
You do not need to create any custom graphics.

![New user screen](doc/img/new_user.png)

The user sign-up form should

- Accept the first name, last name, nickname, and email address
- Each of the inputs is required except nickname
- Validate the email - a simple rule that follows `x@y.z` format
- A submission should be rejected if the email address is already in use

![User admin screen](doc/img/user_list.png)

The user admin screen should

- Display each user's info in a simple format.  You can use a table, cards, or anything else you'd like.


## ✍️ Doing the exercise

This repo is based on a template closer to our tech stack that is meant to help you get started,
but feel free to use a different boilerplate or start with a clean slate.  
You may also add additional NPM libraries as you like.  
It is often just as important to be able to combine various open source libraries into a cohesive product.

It is preferred for you to complete this exercise using:

1. [ReactJS](https://react.dev/) with Typescript
2. [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
3. [Formik](https://formik.org/)
4. [TanStack `react-table`](https://tanstack.com/table/v8/docs/guide/tables)
5. [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) --- with an eye on [component drive design](https://www.componentdriven.org/)

These are some of the tools we use in-house.


## 💯 Evaluation

Your implementation will be evaluated against the following criteria:

- it has to work
- cleanliness and readability of code
- creativity - It's great to show off interesting implementations, but stick to the objectives.  This exercise should not take too long, so don't feel the need to add extra features.
